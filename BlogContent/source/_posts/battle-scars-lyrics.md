[00:38.79]We are All in together

[00:41.10]Call it a grudge

[00:42.16]I call it a better

[00:43.40]Way to Channel my burden

[00:44.71]From hurt and regret

[00:45.94]I refuse to forget that I am who I am

[00:49.19]Not a demon or man

[00:50.50]But I fight to defend

[00:51.66]My life and my friends

[00:52.86]The world that I'm in

[00:54.05]Is the home that I know

[00:55.30]Even though they say I don't really fit when I glow

[00:58.62]

[00:58.65]But This is

[01:00.09]My curse and my strength

[01:01.31]Born of bad blood, but raised with the faith and hope

[01:04.12]That I could do better

[01:05.20]Be better

[01:05.77]Better believe that I will never let a drop of bad blood stop me

[01:09.21]from reaching my destiny ever

[01:11.57]Said I'll never let a drop of bad blood stop me

[01:14.43]from reaching my destiny

[01:16.26]

[01:36.14]I do what I do cause I've chosen my way

[01:38.44]Raised by a rebel

[01:39.66]my path's where I stay

[01:41.86]Never battle for blood

[01:43.06]Or take life without reason

[01:44.61]Trust seeing's believing

[01:46.92]I am what you see

[01:48.02]Bat watch the actions

[01:49.33]When I unleash what's within

[01:51.01]My True heart shaped in love has the fiercest of passion

[01:54.38]

[01:55.28]So I grow and you grow

[01:56.39]Still I know I don't know what my limits are

[01:58.60]Cause it's alwavs in the heat of battle Where

[02:00.37]I need to show and prove

[02:01.93]When it comes down to it (they wanna know)

[02:03.88]"What will you really do！"

[02:05.10]So I train to stay focused

[02:06.84]Let me get loose

[02:07.72]I step from the car

[02:08.77]Take the wheel, I've got demons to deal with

[02:11.09]Unsheathe the sword

[02:12.15]Blue flames ablate

[02:13.37]Ok, let's do this

[02:14.90]

[02:15.65]Set em up / knock em down

[02:16.99]Their's always someone to protect

[02:18.26]And I wanna move now

[02:20.07]No time to debate

[02:21.43]It's not complicated

[02:22.54]While yon want me to wait

[02:23.72]I ready to take the party to whoever wants it

[02:26.53]There's too mueh action going on for me to lay low

[02:29.45]So What I want IS to be as strong as I can be

[02:32.22]Now Let me glow like a beacon of hope

[02:34.14]No I'm not blind to the fact of the techniques

[02:36.84]I lack I'm still a work in progress and

[02:38.72]We're all learning to focus

[02:40.63]But Don't hold me back base on my blood line

[02:43.16]It's origin is not an oracle for my life nor my drive

[02:46.10]Your's choices are your's

[02:47.20]My choices are mine

[02:48.22]I'm choosing to Be the beat bar none

[02:50.52]With friends that help keep me in line

[02:52.52]Cause We are All in together

[02:55.38]with good reason to stand

[02:56.64]We want to live better

[02:57.80]Overcoming loss and fear

[02:59.40]No time to get distracted

[03:01.00]Time is short and the enemy may have more strength at night

[03:04.61]But There is no mission abort

[03:05.89]The only path to cut is forward

[03:07.72]Now let's go for it

[03:09.08]It's past the point of no return

[03:11.23]Time to move forward

[03:12.40]

[03:43.17]But I Don't want Gehenna

[03:44.70]So to Hell with the Devil

[03:46.65]For my family and home

[03:48.01]I'll be a defender

[03:49.42]Count me as a wild card

[03:50.37]Though I am not a weapon
